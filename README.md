# RecallGuard




RecallGuard monitors product recalls and alerts users across web and mobile
interfaces. This repository now includes a small sample backend with tests and
a frontâ€‘end skeleton using React. Mobile apps can be built using React Native
on top of the same API endpoints.



RecallGuard monitors product recalls and alerts users. This repository
contains a minimal prototype skeleton.



## Setup
Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Run tests with `pytest`.


Sample CPSC recall data is provided in `data/cpsc_sample.json` for local
development without external API access.

## Running the scheduler
```bash
export SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///dev.db
python -m backend.db      # (re)create + seed
python run.py             # starts API + scheduler
```

Trigger a manual refresh:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "X-Admin: true" localhost:5000/api/recalls/refresh
```

## Running the dashboard
1. Install Python and Node dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the Flask API and scheduler:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
3. In another terminal, run the React/Next dashboard:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
