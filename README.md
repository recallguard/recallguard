# RecallGuard


Initialize the SQLite database with `python -m backend.db`.
RecallGuard monitors product recalls and alerts users across web and mobile
interfaces. This repository now includes a small sample backend with tests and
a frontâ€‘end skeleton using React. Mobile apps can be built using React Native
on top of the same API endpoints.

RecallGuard monitors product recalls and alerts users. This repository
contains a minimal prototype skeleton.


## Setup
Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Run tests with `pytest`.


Sample CPSC recall data is provided in `data/cpsc_sample.json` for local
development without external API access.
